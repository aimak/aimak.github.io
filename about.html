<p>I've always been "writing stuffs" on the Internet. At the age of 11 I made a website with FrontPage about Zelda and I never stopped.<p>
<p>Sometimes I blogged as aimak.org, but that was before Twitter. Sometimes I just wrote about music and now everyone forgot about it.</p>
<p>I used to be an iOS developer but then I joined <a href="http://pootsy.be">Pootsy</a>.</p>
