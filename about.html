<p>I've always been "writing stuffs" on the Internet. At the age of 11 I made a website with FrontPage about Zelda : Majora's Mask</p> and I never stopped.<p>
<p>Sometimes I blogged as aimak.org, but that was before I joined Twitter. Sometimes I just writed about music and now everyone forgot about it.</p>
<p>I used to be an iOS developer but then I joined Pootsy</p>
